## Modalities

The fungible token implementation supports a couple of `modalities` that dictate the behavior of a specific contract instance. Modalities represent the common expectations around contract usage and behavior. The following section discusses the modalities currently available.

<!-- TODO can any of these modalities be changed after installation? 
If not, add this warning: **IMPORTANT: This mode cannot be changed once the contract has been installed.** -->

### EventsMode

The `EventsMode` modality determines how the installed instance of CEP-18 will handle the recording of events that occur from interacting with the contract. The mode is set by passing a `u8` value to the `events_mode` runtime argument: `--session-arg "events_mode:u8='1'"`. The default behavior is `NoEvents`.

The modality provides two options:

1. `NoEvents`: This modality will signal the contract not to record events. This is the default mode.
2. `CES`: This modality will signal the contract to record events using the [Casper Event Standard (CES)](#casper-event-standard).

| EventsMode | u8  |
| ---------- | --- |
| NoEvents   | 0   |
| CES        | 1   |


#### The Casper Event Standard

`CES` is an option within the `EventsMode` modality that determines how changes to tokens issued by the contract instance will be recorded. Changes are recorded in the `__events` dictionary and can be observed via a node's Server Side Events stream. They may also be viewed by querying the dictionary at any time using the JSON-RPC interface.

<!-- TODO who creates this dictionary? Is it managed by the casper_event_standard crate? -->

The emitted events are encoded according to the [Casper Event Standard](https://github.com/make-software/casper-event-standard), and the schema is visible to an observer reading the `__events_schema` contract named key.

For this CEP-18 reference implementation, the events schema is as follows:

<!-- TODO check the table with the dev team -->

| Event name        | Included values and their type                                 |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mint              | recipient (Key), amount (U256)                                 |
| Burn              | owner (Key), amount (U256)                                     |
| SetAllowance      | owner (Key), spender (Key), allowance (U256)                   |
| IncreaseAllowance | owner (Key), spender (Key), allowance (U256), inc_by (U256)    |
| DecreaseAllowance | owner (Key), spender (Key), allowance (U256), decr_by (U256)   |
| Transfer          | sender (Key), recipient (Key), amount (U256)                   |
| TransferFrom      | spender (Key), owner (Key), recipient (Key), amount (U256)     |
| ChangeSecurity    | pub admin (Key), sec_change_map (BTreeMap<Key, SecurityBadge>) |


### MintBurn

The `MintBurn` modality dictates whether tokens managed by a given instance of a CEP-18 contract can be minted or burnt after contract installation. This modality provides two options:

1. `Disabled`: Tokens cannot be minted nor burnt after contract installation. This is the default mode.
2. `MintAndBurn`: Tokens can be minted and burnt.

| MintBurn    | u8  |
| ----------- | --- |
| Disabled    | 0   |
| MintAndBurn | 1   |

This modality is specified by providing an optional runtime argument during installation. The mode is set by passing a `u8` value to the `enable_mint_burn` runtime argument: `--session-arg "enable_mint_burn:u8='1'"`. The default behavior is `Disabled`.

### Example Installation

Here is a sample deploy installing a fungible token with event logging and minting and burning enabled:

```bash
casper-client put-deploy \
--node-address http://65.21.235.219:7777  \
--chain-name casper-test \
--secret-key ~/KEYS/secret_key.pem \
--payment-amount 120000000000 \
--session-path ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/cep18.wasm \
--session-arg "name:string='Test Token'" \
--session-arg "symbol:string='DEMO'" \
--session-arg "total_supply:u256='100'" \
--session-arg "decimals:u8='2'" \
--session-arg "events_mode:u8='1'" \
--session-arg "enable_mint_burn:u8='1'"
```

## Testing

This repository contains several ways of testing the fungible token contract.

1. The test suite found in the [tests](../tests/) folder asserts the expected behavior of the contract implementation. It also ensures that no regressions and conflicting behaviors are introduced as functionality is added or extended. The tests can be run by using the provided `Makefile` and running the `make test` command.

2. A test contract that calls the entry points in the fungible token contract is also available in the [cep18-test-contract](../cep18-test-contract/) folder.

3. The JavaScript client in the [client-js](../client-js/README.md) folder has unit tests and end-to-end integration tests.

4. A set of benchmarking scripts is also available in the [cost-benchmarking](../cost-benchmarking/README.md) folder, for testing gas costs of basic operations.
